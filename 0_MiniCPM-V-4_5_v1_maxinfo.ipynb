      "Model answer: 't just look like a dog or cat but rather are things that actually tell us something about the underlying process by which we might be able to make more accurate predictions and I think that's what we'll end on with this slide it doesn't really have anything in particular to do right now you can imagine trying to apply these ideas of minimizing KL divergence between two probability distributions how would that sort of work if your objective is prediction well one way you could try to minimize the KL Divergence between the distribution over images and labels that comes from the real world versus some model that you want to build for example you know that maybe I'm going to use a neural network as my model and then you're going to say okay so let me define my model to take an image and spit out a label and I don't need to worry too much about the details of the relationship between those because they were already encoded into the KL Divergence and you're not allowed any assumptions other than the fact that the distribution over images and labels should be close to each other and here's where I feel like we get stuck I mean the problem is that we've lost all control over whether our model has learned the right thing or not does it capture the true function that generates data or does it learn some arbitrary function that happens to fit the data well I guess you kind of realize that this isn't a new idea I think people have been thinking along similar lines before and that was sort of the first paper that I ever wrote called the Bayesian neural network and it basically said if you train a neural network using this objective you get a nice little surprise when you look at the parameters of your neural network you find them to correspond to the parameters of a Bayesian Neural Network and that is to say that your model ends up being exactly equivalent to a Bayesian neural network but wait if you set up your objective to optimize the predictive power of your model you will always end up learning a Bayesian neural network no matter what your prior looks like and so you lose all control over what your model learns and you also run into problems related to overfitting and generalization and things like that and so I guess the point I wanted to make clear is that there exists another whole branch of machine learning that focuses entirely on making sure that you're building models that produce good explanations instead of focusing only on predicting stuff and I believe that doing that allows you to gain better control over what sorts of representations you learn and that leads you towards finding more informative theories of the structure of nature but it requires a very different approach to optimization and training algorithms and yeah this is probably why most people aren't aware of this part of science um it's interesting to note though that the variational autoencoder was originally invented in 1980 in a paper by you know Jaynes and the authors didn't call it a variational autoencoder they used a completely different name for it but it wasn't until recently that people started talking about this in the context of machine learning did we start calling it a variational autoencoder and once you do that it becomes immediately obvious that this is sort of yet another instance of the same type of strategy that we've seen everywhere else in physics and information theory that's to say that the way that we search for an objective that minimizes the KL Divergence between two probability distributions is sort of the exact same thing that you do when you try to design a physical system and it works equally well to construct a physical law or to come up with a description of the universe that explains observations and I wonder if this connection might lead to some insight especially since you know people keep coming back to this object again and again every time that they discover something new about neural networks they seem to be discovering that you can express it as a sort of variational objective and then suddenly people claim that the variational autoencoder is somehow fundamentally distinct from ordinary Auto encoders and that's not quite true you know it seems like there must be a deeper story behind it and I hope that by describing this recipe you see that there is indeed a deep connection but that it's far from obvious so I suppose the main reason why people talk about it as being distinct is simply that the variational autoencoder is trained in a supervised manner whereas the ordinary Auto encoder is not but I want to emphasize that in this sense the difference is somewhat artificial because if you think about the typical way that you do supervised learning you write down a model that takes input X and output Y and you assign to it a loss function and you try to minimize that loss through gradient descent you can view that entire procedure as implicitly assuming that the noise in the real world is generated according to some fixed stochastic process and that you're attempting to approximate that noise process and the Variational Autoencoder is explicitly modeling that noise process it's explicit it's saying that the noise in the real world is sampled according to some random variable Z and you're gonna sample a stochastic process to generate your data and you're trying to match that stochastic process with the stochastic process that you've learned but that sounds almost identical to what you'd expect from a physics perspective or an information-theoretic perspective I think it's still possible to show that these are essentially the same thing except in the case of variational Auto encoders you know the marginal likelihood maximizer is missing a term that corresponds to the prior and the prior is usually assumed to be uniform but otherwise the math is exactly the same and so I'm going to stop short of giving you the technicalities of that proof but I wish I had time to go further and argue that this is really just the same thing and that you can recover ordinary Auto encoders under certain conditions and vice versa and that you can even connect variational Auto encoders to the thing that we talked about earlier the variational information bottleneck and it turns out that all of these objectives that I've described today are closely related to each other and that they all arise naturally from the same basic principles and the key difference is that the variational autoencoder is designed to predict a future observation given past ones while the variational information bottleneck is designed to maximize mutual information and that's really just a slightly different way of phrasing the same thing and you can prove that you can turn one into the other depending upon your choice of auxiliary variables and I think that this is the source of confusion is that people often refer to variational Auto encoders as unsupervised learning techniques and I think that's confusing because variational Auto encoders are always defined relative to some prior distribution and so their performance depends critically on the choice of that prior and the resulting posterior and so you cannot consider them truly unsupervised unless you assume something special such as a uniform distribution but anyway I guess the larger point is that there may be many ways to formulate a particular task as a variational problem and that they're all connected together in some way and I don't necessarily know what properties of that allow them to behave differently and that's really hard to pin down but I think if you follow the recipe that I gave you in a sort of consistent fashion you're going to arrive a different objective and a different solution space and I think that makes all the difference in practice and I think it's important to understand that there exist multiple routes forward to designing effective machine learning systems and that there's lots of opportunities for creativity and exploration I think that's pretty much everything I got time to say thank you guys for listening thanks\n",
